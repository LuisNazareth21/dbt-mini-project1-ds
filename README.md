# DigitalSkola_MiniProject_1
**First Simple ETL Project**

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process focusing on:
1. Extracting data from an OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) database.
2. Transforming the data within a Data Warehouse (DWH).
3. Loading transformed data into Datamart tables.
4. Visualizing insights using Looker.

## ETL Process

### Extracting OLTP to DWH
The ETL process begins with extracting data from the OLTP database. This involves querying transactional data and transferring it to the Data Warehouse for further processing.

### Transforming and Loading to Datamart
After extraction, the data undergoes transformation within the Data Warehouse. This step includes cleaning, integrating, and aggregating the data to prepare it for analytical purposes. Transformed data is then loaded into Datamart tables optimized for reporting and analysis.

## Visualization in Looker
Using Looker, the Datamart tables are connected to create insightful visualizations. Looker allows us to build interactive dashboards and reports, enabling stakeholders to gain actionable insights from the transformed data.
